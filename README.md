# JCSCC Engine

JCSCC is a C/C++ game engine that provide a simple programming interface
to do a cross-platform native code game. Include resource manager with
secure deocode and encode algorithm. The purpose of the project is to
learn how a game engine were made, knowing the game engine architecture
and able to use it knowledge apply to all other modern game engine.<br/><br/>


## Notice

JCSCC Engine uses many kind of API/Libraries, for more detail information
can be found in 'JCS_VERSION' file at the root directory of this project.
In other word, this project does not help learning how to build your own
graphic, sound, socket, all kind of API.


## Features

* Animation System - Sprite base animation system.
* GUI Interface - simple MVC GUI interface implementation.
* Network/Socket - Very basic TCP/UDP client socket.
* Resource Manager - manage all resources by it own structure, include decode
and encode.
* Scripting Interface - Lua scripting interface.
* Sound System - Simple audio manager.
* Input System - Simple cross-platform input managers.
